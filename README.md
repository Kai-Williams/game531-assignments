Assignment 3 - This program was made using OpenTK. It makes it easier to use OpenGL for the graphics. The cube is built from 8 unique points (vertices) in 3D space. Instead of repeating points I use an index buffer to connect them to form the faces of the cube. The program uses three types of transformations: the model matrix rotates and moves the cube, the view matrix acts like a camera to position the scene, and the projection matrix gives perspective so the cube looks 3D. The program also includes rotation. The cube spins automatically on its own, and you can click and drag with the mouse to rotate it manually.
